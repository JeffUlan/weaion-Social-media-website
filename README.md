# weaion
a social media website using Node Mongodb Express

here is the link
https://weaion.herokuapp.com/


 # BIG CONS
1.here heroku Server didn't support Node js File system . It's Support AWS storage .But AWS storge is costly for me i can't affort it. 
So when u upload a photo for post or profile or Coverphoto in https://weaion.herokuapp.com/ . The Photo will be Save for temporary .And  
after some couple of Hour. the photo autometically will be delete.

**But if you clone or download the project and run your computer there will be on issue... it will work soomthly
